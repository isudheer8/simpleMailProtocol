# 📧 Simple Email Configuration using Cisco Packet Tracer

This project demonstrates how to set up a basic email communication system using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. It includes DHCP, DNS, and Email Server configurations to simulate real-world network email operations between users.

---

## 🔧 Tools Used

- Cisco Packet Tracer
- Networking Components (DHCP Server, DNS Server, Email Servers, PCs, Switches)
- Email Protocols: SMTP, POP3

---

## 🗂️ Project Overview

The network includes:

- **DHCP Server**: Automatically assigns IP addresses.
- **DNS Server**: Resolves domain names like `gmail.com` and `hotmail.com`.
- **Gmail & Hotmail Email Servers**: Handles sending and receiving of emails.
- **Client PCs**: Configured with email addresses to test communication.

---

## 🛠️ Configuration Steps

1. **Network Topology Setup**
   - Connect DHCP, DNS, Gmail, Hotmail servers, and 4 client PCs via switches.

2. **DHCP Configuration**
   - Set default gateway, subnet mask, and IP range.
   - Enable DHCP service on server.

3. **DNS Configuration**
   - Map domain names to respective IP addresses.
   - Enable DNS service and save entries.

4. **Email Server Setup**
   - Configure SMTP/POP3.
   - Add email users for Gmail and Hotmail domains.

5. **Email Clients Setup**
   - Configure client email settings (incoming/outgoing servers).
   - Save and verify credentials.

6. **Testing**
   - Send and receive emails between users (e.g., `sudheer@gmail.com` to `vineel@gmail.com`).
   - Confirm bidirectional communication and domain resolution.

## ✅ Outcome

- Successfully simulated email exchange over a LAN using Cisco Packet Tracer.
- Demonstrated understanding of email protocols and network server configuration.
- Useful as a foundational project for network engineers and beginners.
